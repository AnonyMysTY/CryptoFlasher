CryptoFlasherV2 is a blockchain transaction simulation and visualization platform designed for testing, performance analysis, and live demonstrations within a controlled network environment. It allows users to generate high volumes of fully customizable Bitcoin transaction activity and observe how transaction flows behave between addresses modeled after major blockchain platforms such as Coinbase, Binance, and Blockchain.com.

Built on a customized Bitcoin-based framework, CryptoFlasherV2 broadcasts testnet-style transaction data across a dedicated parallel network layer. These simulated transactions can appear temporarily within supported demo interfaces modeled after services like Bybit and LocalBitcoins, enabling users to monitor transaction behavior, balance changes, and flow patterns over time.

Transaction visibility depends on the selected license tier:

Standard License: visibility for up to 90 days

Premium License: visibility for up to 360 days

After the visibility period expires, all simulated data is automatically cleared.
